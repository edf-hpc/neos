Synopsis
========

**neos** *options* [-s --scenario *scenario*]

Description
===========

NEOS is a software which provides a generic framework to manage job sessions
on HPC clusters.

The framework is based on scenarios. A scenario defines the sequential steps to
properly setup and initialize the job session. Users select the scenario for
their jobs and can even define their own scenarios. The frawework can manage a
wide variety of workloads from classic MPI parallel computing to advanced
visualization sessions with 3D remote rendering.

Global options
==============

    -h, --help    Show help message and exit.
    --version     Print NEOS version and exit.
    -d, --debug   Enable debug output.
    --dry-run     Dry-run mode: print commands to run without actually running them.
    -l, --log     Log commands output instead of printing on stdout/stderr.
    -k, --keep    Do not remove temporary files generated by NEOS.
    -L, --list    List available scenarios with their optional parameters.
    -s, --scenario=SCENARIO
        Name of scenario to run.
    -S, --scenarios-dir=DIR
        Path to directory with additional scenarios to load.
    -m, --module=MODULE
        Name of environment module to load?
    -M, --modules-dir=DIR
        Path to directory with additional modules.
    -o, --opts=OPTS
        Optional parameters for scenarios.


Environment modules
===================

NEOS can load system-wide and user defined environment modules files. To load
system-wide module, just set their name with `-m, --module` parameter.

You can also define specific environment modules files and load them with NEOS.
For example, if you define this environment module in *~/modules/mymodule*::

    #%Module

    module-whatis {Description: My own module for my own scenario}

    if { ![is-loaded OtherModule/0.0.1] } {
        module load OtherModule/0.0.1
    }

    prepend-path    PATH            ~/bin

    setenv  ENVFORSCENARIO          "testenv"

The module file first contains a description and a dependency to another module
named **OtherModule/0.0.1**. Then, it prepends the `$PATH` environment variable
with *~/bin*. Finally, it sets the `$ENVFORSCENARIO` with value *testenv*.
Please refer to **modules** documentation for more details.

This specific module file can be loaded by NEOS with the following parameters::

    neos --modules-dir=~/modules --module=mymodule [OPTIONS]

Specific scenarios
==================

With NEOS, users can run scenarios available on the system but they can also
define their own scenarios. Please refer to the scenario writing guide for
reference.

As an example, if a scenario is defined in file *~/scenarios/simple.py* and it
is called *foo*, it can be loaded and run by NEOS using the following
parameters::

    neos --scenarios-dir=~/scenarios --scenario=foo

Integration with Slurm
======================

NEOS can run scenarios in Slurm job step context only. In other words, it is
impossible to run scenario outside of jobs, except for listing scenarios and
options, getting command line helper and printing version.

To run NEOS scenarios, Slurm commands must be used.

srun command
------------

The most straighforward way to launch NEOS scenario is to use `srun` command
from the frontend node. For example::

    $ ssh login@cluster
    $ srun -n 4 neos

In this example, `srun` will create an job allocation for 4 tasks (or CPUs) and
launch NEOS with default scenario on those resources. Please note that you may
need to specify other parameters (such as the partition or the QOS) depending
on the cluster configuration.

Please refer to Slurm documentation and `srun` manpage for reference.

salloc command
--------------

Slurm `salloc` command create a resources allocation and runs a command from
the frontend node. By default, without any command given in parameter, it
spawns a new shell on the frontend node within the job allocation environment.
To run a scenario on the allocated resources, you must use `srun` command as
well. For example::

    $ ssh login@cluster
    $ salloc -n 4       # allocate 4 CPUs
    $ srun neos         # runs NEOS on all allocated resources

The main advantage of this mode is that you can run multiple scenarios in one
job allocation.

Please refer to Slurm documentation and `salloc` manpage for reference.

sbatch command
--------------

Slurm `sbatch` command can submit job for later execution. It is recommanded to
give a submission script in parameter of this command. This script specifies
the allocation constraints. It is run on the first allocated node once the job
is started. Here is an example of sbatch submission script *submit.sh* to run
a NEOS scenario::

    #!/bin/sh
    #SBATCH -n 4
    neos

This script can then be submited to Slurm with `sbatch` command::

    $ sbatch submit.sh

Please refer to Slurm documentation and `sbatch` manpage for reference.

Controlling output
==================

NEOS produces 2 types of outputs:

- NEOS internal output, including information, warning, errors reported by the
  software itself, as well as debug messages when `-d, --debug` flag is enabled
  on the command line.
- outputs of sub-commands launched by scenarios.

By default, all these outputs are mixed within stdout and stderr of NEOS
process. The sub-commands outputs can be redirected in a logfile using the
`-l, --log` flag. The destination log file can be set using the `--opts`
parameter like this::

    $ neos --log --opts logfile:~/neos.log

The default value of this optional parameter can be obtained with `-L, --list`.

As stated before, NEOS must be launched by Slurm workload manager. Slurm is
able to manage job processes outputs in many advanced ways.

By default, when run interactively, `srun` redirects all the programs outputs
launched on the allocated nodes to the TTY of the user on the frontend node.
This behaviour can be controlled using `--output` parameter. For example,
outputs can be completely discarded with::

    srun --output=none neos [OPTIONS]

All outputs can also be written in a logfile::

    srun --output=srun.log neos [OPTIONS]

This way, *srun.log* will contain all outputs (including errors) produced by
NEOS and all the sub-commands launched by the scenarios. The filenames can also
contain various job related variables such as the job ID and the step ID using
placeholders (ex: `--output=srun_%j-%s_out.log`). Please refer to `srun`
manpage for the full list of available placeholders.

It is also possible to separate stdout and stderr using the `--error`
parameter::

    srun --output=srun_%j-%s_out.log --error=srun_%j-%s_err.log neos [OPTIONS]

The outputs of batch jobs submitted with the `sbatch` command are redirected by
default to the file *./slurm-%j.out*. Just as well as `srun` command, the
`sbatch` command has the `--output` and `--error` parameters to control the
destination of the outputs.

Please refer to `sbatch` manpage for all details.

Slurm and NEOS parameters can be combined to separate all types of outputs::

    srun --output=srun-out.log --error=srun-err.log neos --log --opts=logfile:~/neos.log

With the previous commands, the content of the various files are:

* *srun-out.log* contains the information (and eventually debug if enabled)
  produced internally by NEOS,
* *srun-err.log* contains the warning and errors produced internally by NEOS,
* *neos.log* contains the outputs the sub-commands launched by NEOS scenarios.
